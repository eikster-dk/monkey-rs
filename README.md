# monkey-rs
Writing monkey in rust. Following along "Writing an interpreter in Go"

# My way of working
- Writing the code as close to the book as possible. This might not be as idiom rust but gives me a great understanding of where the book is heading.
- When chapter is done and all tests are written, I refactor into more idiom Rust (as i learn more and more about idiom rust)
- Work on the next chapter
